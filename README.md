# Calculator-App
I've created a calculator using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Using HTML to create the webpage layout and vanilla CSS to style the webpage and add responsiveness to it. Javasscript is used to add the dynamic functionalities to the app. All the basic arithmetic operations can be done on my Calculator App.
